All-sky CGW search code (Polgraw group)

This code searches for continuous gravitational waves  
in time-domain data using the F-statistic on data 
from a network of detectors in a region given with 
the spotlight data file. 
Currently the available detectors are H1 (Hanford), 
L1 (Livingston) of LIGO and V1 (Cascina) of Virgo. 
See doc/readme_search.txt for some details (documentation 
may not be complete).
