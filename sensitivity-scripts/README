These bash scripts are setting up the subdirectories in which 
the search and coincidences runs are performed with injected 
signals added to the data (in order to establish the sensitivity 
of the search). 

1/ mcsim.sh - main script (configure the paths and variables inside) 
Also: 
2/ prepare.sh - main helper script 
3/ script_manyframes.sh - dummy script changed by prepare.sh and run by job.sub 
4/ job.sub - torque pbs job script 

band_h0.list - list with band numbers and amplitudes to test 

How to configure: 

1/ Configure paths and other variables on top of mcsim.sh (these 
values and passed on to the prepare.sh script in each subdirectory created). 

How to run: 

mcsim.sh requires a location of *band_h0.list* file 
that contains list of bands and amplitudes, for example 

0165 6.00e-1
0166 4.60e-1 3.50e-1 2.00e-1

Example call: 

$ ./mcsim.sh /home/michal/polgraw-allsky/scripts/band_h0.list  

End results (summary how many out of 100 simulations crossed a coincidence 
threshold of 0.7 for bands in the range of 0301-0350): 

$ ./mcsummary.sh <(seq -f %04g 301 350) 0.7 100
